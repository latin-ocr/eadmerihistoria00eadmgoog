w It would seem to heve been during St. Anselm s second

λι &exile that Eadmer first gave effect to the idea ol eorn-

· h posing a florilegium ol anecdotos about his master Tho

hyena under the root oi Arehbishop Hugh; but during

two oi the hottest months ol the summer he was the

guest ol the saintly Abbot ol Cluny. hbbot Hugh

apered no pains to entertain his guest by telling bima

sev stories ot' slight intrinsie interest,but ot' considerable

velue to us by reason os the light they rhed on the lit'e

and converse ol all sorta os men in those ‹lnys; ond
Anselrn in histum would now tell some wonderful tale, ’

nbout the reality oi which he scenis to hore been philo·

sophr'tally indifferent, and now record aorne interesting

incidentia his own life. His romantio storics have been

reeonled by Alexander, a Christ Choreb monh, one ol

the eompnnions ot' . his exile, and his biographical anec-

dotos, or, at least, some ol thern, by Eorlmer3 whilst a

series ol cennens which he preeehed during the visit

hu been reported with characteristic differenees by

both one and the other. Eadmer's copy os the ‘⁴ Beetitudo

Perennis Vitre,” sor that was the subject ol the sermons,
