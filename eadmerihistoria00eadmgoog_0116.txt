aa well aa earlier, and in two ot' them we find that later
work awkwardly intruded into the earlier.

What rs true ol these these three cases would seem to

he true es the explicit to the poem “,Tange Syen, ,

“ιίῑ1ιιιιιιιι”’ ιιι 1 (178 v.,') Explicit Vita Sancti An·

'l’lrat the italicised words are an intrusiro gloss ia
prebnble enough lrorn the analogy oi the preceding⁴
instaures, and morally certain lrorn their correspondenee
with tlte close ol the rubrio which puazled Wlarton.

How the cilicinus scribeola later age eametooon·
found Eadmerand Elrncr is a question el comparative
unimportanoe. By drawing attention to lris gloases nnd
showing thern to have been awkwardly wolded with
earlier work, I have donc all that ia necessary. Still Ι
cannot reirain srorn observing that tlre title given in 1. to
Fadmer's letter to the Glastonbury monlrs reads thus,
“Epistola ad Glastonienses Elmcri aliter Mureti quo ’
· tempore Glutenienses asseruerunt se eorpus patroni
“nostri Sancti Dunstani habere” .
